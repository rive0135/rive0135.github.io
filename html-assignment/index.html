            Hi, welcome to my domain! My name is Roniel Rivera, and I'm from the <strong>Philippines.</strong>

        <p>
            I moved to Canada in 2015 and currently reside in Orleans, Ottawa.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to do anything related to videos and photos, whether it's <abbr title="Motion Graphics">MoGraph</abbr> or graphics designing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to play video games that are challenging while having fun at the same time.
        </p>

            <blockquote><em><cite><a href="https://www.magicalquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-greatest-teacher-failure-is.jpg" target="-blank">the greatest teacher, failure is  - Master Yoda.</a></cite></em></blockquote> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I have accepted my failures as a lesson to myself.
