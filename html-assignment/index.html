            Hi, welcome to my domain! My name is Roniel Rivera, and I'm from the <strong>Philippines.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I moved to Canada in 2015 and currently reside in Orleans, Ottawa.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to do anything related to videos and photos, whether it's <abbr title="Motion Graphics">MoGraph</abbr> or graphics designing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to play video games that are challenging while having fun at the same time.
        </p>
        <!--Paragraph 2-->
        <p>
            As for my passion for video editing or motion graphic animation, I have encountered many problems as I go.
        </p>
        <p>
            Failing a course or program is one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was thinking of giving up and choose for a different program,
        </p>

            but as I was thinking about it, a post from a friend of mine who likes Star Wars showed me a photo stating,
        </p>
            <blockquote><em><cite><a href="https://www.magicalquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-greatest-teacher-failure-is.jpg" target="-blank">the greatest teacher, failure is  - Master Yoda.</a></cite></em></blockquote> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, I have accepted my failures as a lesson to myself.
